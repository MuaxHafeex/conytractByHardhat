# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:


Pre-requisitesâ€‹
There are a few technical requirements before we start as listed below:
```shell
    Node.js v10+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
    Git
    Create an empty project npm init --yes
    Once your project is ready, run npm install --save-dev hardhat to install Hardhat.
    Install hardhat toolbox npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
    To use your local installation of Hardhat, you need to use npx to run it (i.e. npx hardhat).
```


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
